In this project I coded the game of BlackJack. 

This is a simplified version where features like 'side bets', 'double-down', 'split', and 'insurance' are not included.

The idea of this game is to get your sum of the value of your cards as close to 21 without going over 21. Whoever is closest to 21 wins!
